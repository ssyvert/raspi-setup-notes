== setup SD card with raspian jessie (terminal commands in mac) ==

unmount any disks that relate to the SD card
[mac]	> diskutil list

enable ssh by placing an empty file called ssh in /boot/ (not entirely clear which one they meant so I'm trying both places called boot):
[mac]	> sudo touch /Volumes/Untitled/boot/ssh
[mac]	> sudo touch /Volumes/boot/ssh

add wifi creds (add indented bit after command to the file)
[mac]	> sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
+		network={
+				ssid="network_name"
+				psk="password"
+		}

(put SD card in and boot raspi)

find the IP using terminal in mac and connect to it
[mac]	> sudo nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24
[mac]	> ssh pi@192.168.0.120

set a new password because duh
[pi]	> passwd

bring over public key using scp
[mac]	> scp ~/.ssh/syvert.pub pi@192.168.0.120:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
[pi]	> chmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

disable login with password
[pi]	> sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
